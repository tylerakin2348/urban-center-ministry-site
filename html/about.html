          <p>The Dehoney Family</p>
          <p>
            Wayne Dehoney served as the Senior Pastor of Walnut Street Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, from 1967-1985. Through his leadership, Walnut Street Baptist stayed in the city when members and others were fleeing to the suburbs. He led the church to reach the urban community around the church. The church developed an entire city block around the church that provided ministry and assistance to those in need.
            <p>Wayne Dehoney also served two terms as the President of the Southern Baptist Convention. Lealice Dehoney supported and ministered with her husband for 63 years.</p>
            <p>The Billy Graham School
Southern Baptists have a long tradition of being missions-oriented. The Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism, and Ministry at Southern Seminary continues that historic tradition.

Our goal is to equip students for ministry as pastors, teachers, evangelists, missionaries, urban ministers, church planters, and denominational workers whose passion for God’s glory propels them ever forward as they reach out to a lost and dying world.
