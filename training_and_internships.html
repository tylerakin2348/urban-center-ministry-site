        <p>Urban Ministry Internships
Dehoney Center internships offer students a unique opportunity during their studies at Southern Seminary to explore urban ministry roles, gain valuable experience, and serve either one or two semesters alongside an experienced urban ministry leader. Every student considering ministry in a city or metropolitan region should consider an internship before graduation.
